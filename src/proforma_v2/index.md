Proteoform and Peptidoform Notation

This document provides information to the proteomics community about a proposed extension of the standard proteoform notation called ProForma. Distribution is unlimited.

## Abstract

The Human Proteome Organisation (HUPO) Proteomics Standards Initiative
(PSI) defines community standards for data representation in proteomics
to facilitate data comparison, exchange and verification. This document
presents a specification for a proteoform and peptidoform notation,
which is based on the ProForma notation {{#cite leduc_proforma_2018}}, previously published by
the Consortium for Top-Down Proteomics.

Further detailed information, including any updates to this document,
implementations, and examples is available at
