LINK TO THE ONLINE BOOK

This repository is an individual initative to format and edit specification documents for proteomics file formats. This book is only possible thanks to the work of the [HUPO Proteomics Standards initiative](https://www.psidev.info/) contributors. Credits and author information will be available for each document.
